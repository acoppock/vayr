\usage{
position_jitterdodge_ellipse(
  jitter.width = NULL,
  jitter.height = 0,
  dodge.width = 0.75,
  seed = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{jitter.width}{degree of jitter in x direction. Defaults to 40\% of the
resolution of the data.}

\item{jitter.height}{degree of jitter in y direction. Defaults to 0.}

\item{dodge.width}{the amount to dodge in the x direction. Defaults to 0.75,
the default \code{position_dodge()} width.}

\item{seed}{A random seed to make the jitter reproducible.
Useful if you need to apply the same jitter twice, e.g., for a point and
a corresponding label.
The random seed is reset after jittering.
If \code{NA} (the default value), the seed is initialised with a random value;
this makes sure that two subsequent calls start with a different seed.
Use \code{NULL} to use the current random seed and also avoid resetting
(the behaviour of \pkg{ggplot} 2.2.1 and earlier).}
