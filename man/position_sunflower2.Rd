\title{Arrange over-plotted points in a sunflower pattern}
\usage{
position_sunflower2(density = 1, aspect_ratio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{density}{seed density}

\item{aspect_ratio}{aspect ratio adjustment}
}
\description{
This function applies the sunflower algorithm, as executed by the sunflower function, as a position adjustment,
arranging overlapping points at any given x and y into a sunflower pattern.
}
\examples{

library(tidyverse)
# Use the sunflower position function to arrange points
N <- 100
dat <- tibble(
  x = rep(1:4, times = N),
  y = rep(1:4, times = N)
)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, position = position_sunflower2(density = 1, aspect_ratio = 1)) +
  xlim(0, 5) +
  ylim(0, 5) +
  coord_equal()
