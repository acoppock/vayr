\title{Use circle packing to avoid over-plotting

This function uses circle packing algorithms from the "packcircles" package
to arrange perfectly over-plotted points of varying sizes into a elliptical area.
The density and the aspect ratio can be adjusted, and the circle pack can be
random or ordered by size (ascending or descending). Because the function is a
position adjustment, the correct density will be a factor of both the image size
and the limits of the x and y axes.}
\usage{
position_circlepack(density = 1, aspect_ratio = 1, arrange = "random")
}
\arguments{
\item{density}{density of the circle pack}

\item{aspect_ratio}{aspect_ratio adjustment of the elliptical area}

\item{arrange}{order by which the circles are packed}
}
