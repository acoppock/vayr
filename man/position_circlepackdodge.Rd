\title{Arrange over-plotted points with a circle-packing algorithm and dodge groups side-to-side

This function dodges groups and arranges the over-plotted points (of various sizes)
using algorithms from the "packcirles" package. The algorithms are applied per group.}
\usage{
position_circlepackdodge(
  width = NULL,
  density = 1,
  aspect_ratio = 1,
  arrange = "random"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{width}{dodging width}

\item{density}{density of the circle pack}

\item{aspect_ratio}{aspect_ratio adjustment of the elliptical area}

\item{arrange}{order by which the circles are packed}
}
