\title{Jitter points on an ellipse to avoid over-plotting}
\usage{
position_jitter_ellipse(width = NULL, height = NULL, seed = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{width, height}{Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter
is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread
is twice the value specified here.

If omitted, defaults to 40\% of the resolution of the data: this means the
jitter values will occupy 80\% of the implied bins. Categorical data
is aligned on the integers, so a width or height of 0.5 will spread the
data so it's not possible to see the distinction between the categories.}

\item{seed}{A random seed to make the jitter reproducible.
Useful if you need to apply the same jitter twice, e.g., for a point and
a corresponding label.
The random seed is reset after jittering.
If \code{NA} (the default value), the seed is initialised with a random value;
this makes sure that two subsequent calls start with a different seed.
Use \code{NULL} to use the current random seed and also avoid resetting
(the behaviour of \pkg{ggplot} 2.2.1 and earlier).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggproto} object of class \code{PositionJitterEllipse}
}
\description{
This function adds elliptical random noise to perfectly over-plotted points,
offering a pleasing way to visualize many points that represent the same position.
In contrast to the position_jitter function which samples on a rectangle, the position_jitter_ellipse function samples on an ellipse.
This function takes algorithmic inspiration from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5529148/algorithm-calculate-pseudo-random-point-inside-an-ellipse
and https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/120527/simulate-a-uniform-distribution-on-a-disc.
